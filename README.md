**Maskito** is a collection of libraries, built on Typescript. It helps to create an input mask which ensures that user
types value according to predefined format.

## Why Maskito

- Maskito supports all user’s interactions with textfield: basic typing and deleting via keyboard, pasting, dropping
  text inside textfield, browser autofill, predictive text from mobile native keyboard.

- Maskito is robust. The whole project is developed with strict TypeScript mode. Our code is covered by hundreds of
  [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) tests.

- Server Side Rendering support.

- You can use it with `HTMLInputElement` and `HTMLTextAreaElement`.

- Maskito's core is zero-dependency package. You can mask input in your Vanilla Javascript project. However, we have a
  separate package for Angular as well.

- Maskito includes optional framework-agnostic package with configurable ready-to-use masks.

No textfield with invalid value! Use Maskito. **Mask it!**
