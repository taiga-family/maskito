**Maskito** is a collection of libraries, built with TypeScript. It helps you to create an input mask which ensures that
users type values according to predefined format.

## Why Maskito

- **Maskito** supports all userâ€™s interactions with text fields: basic typing and deleting via keyboard, pasting,
  dropping text inside with a pointer, browser autofill, predictive text from mobile native keyboard.

- **Maskito** is robust. The whole project is developed with strict TypeScript mode. Our code is covered by hundreds of
  [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) tests.

- ServerÂ SideÂ Rendering and Shadow DOM support.

- You can use it with `HTMLInputElement` and `HTMLTextAreaElement`.

- **Maskito** core is zero-dependency package. You can mask input in your vanilla JavaScript project. However, we have
  separate packages for Angular, React and Vue as well.

- **Maskito** includes optional framework-agnostic package with configurable ready-to-use masks.

No text field with invalid value! Use Maskito. **Mask it!** Learn more about the library in our
[documentation](https://maskito.dev).
