            <strong>Maskito</strong>
            libraries were created to prevent user from typing invalid value.
            <br />
            <strong>Maskito</strong>
            listens
            <code>beforeinput</code>
            and
            <code>input</code>
            events. Programmatic (by developer) changes of input's value don't trigger these events!
        </p>

        <tui-notification>
            <strong>Maskito</strong>
            is based on the assumption that developer is capable to programmatically patch input with
            <u>valid</u>
            value!
        </tui-notification>

        <p>
            If you need to programmatically patch input's value but you are not sure that your value is valid (for
            example, you get it from the server), you should use
            <code>maskitoTransform</code>
            utility .
