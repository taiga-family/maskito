<p>
    In
    <code>strict</code>
    mode, if a user tries to enter a non-valid date, the mask will either prevent the user from entering such a date, or
    if it is possible to turn it into a valid date, it will change it to a valid date. Textfield's value
    <strong>NEVER</strong>
    contains invalid date value.
</p>
<p>
    In
    <code>non-strict</code>
    mode, textfield sometimes can contains not-valid date (i.e. 31st day for month with only 30 days).
