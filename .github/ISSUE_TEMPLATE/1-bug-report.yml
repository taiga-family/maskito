        Link to an isolated reproduction in our [StackBlitz playground](https://maskito.dev/stackblitz).

        If either of the following holds true:
        - You can't reproduce the issue in the playground
        - Your issue requires some complex setup - such as multiple files or a specific folder structure.

        So you can use any link that might help for reproduction bug: github repo, demo url, etc.
